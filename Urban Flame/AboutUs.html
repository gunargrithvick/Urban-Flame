            <h1>About Urban Flame</h1>
            <p>
                Urban Flame is a contemporary restaurant concept that has become popular for its fusion of modern culinary techniques, global flavors, and a focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients. The name "Urban Flame" reflects the core cooking method of the restaurant: flame grilling and wood-fired cooking, which imparts a distinct smoky flavor and charred texture to the dishes. This technique, often associated with traditional barbecue or open-flame cooking, is modernized in an urban setting, combining the rustic appeal of flame-cooked meals with sleek, urban aesthetics.
